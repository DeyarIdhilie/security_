# security_this project is an implementation for 2 used techniques in cryptography for security courese
those 2 techniques are : least simple substitution and rails fence cipher
it was implememnted using java 
the user of this project could preform encryption , decryption and cracking using each tech
the used cracking method to crack a cipher which was encrypted in least simple substitution was frequenct crypto-analysis
in which the freq of each letter is calculated and the assigned to the possible original letter using the known destribution of letter in English
